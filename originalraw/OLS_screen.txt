# We have provided you with a zip file containing sample quality control information for
# 300 sequencing batches. Each file contains data for one batch containing 96 samples.
# These sequencing samples were processed with the below workflow. Column names are noted
# in parentheses.

# 1. DNA extraction ("sample_type" and sample "barcode" recorded)
# 2. DNA fragmentation
#     - in-process QC metric: average fragment size ("frag_size")
#     - in-process QC metric: DNA concentration ("pre_quant")
# 3. library preparation
#     a. blunt-end
#     b. A-tailing
#     c. adapter ligation
# 4. PCR
#     - in-process QC metric: DNA concentration ("post_quant")
# 5. target enrichment
# 6. sequencing
#     - sequencing QC flag: sequencing coverage ("coverage")
#     - sequencing QC flag: reliable CNV calling ("CNV_calling")
#     - Sample quality is assessed during calling review using QC metrics and manual
#		inspection of the data to make a final call ("passing_well")

## Part 1
# A) What percentage of samples have passed sequencing QC? What percentage have failed due to
# low sequencing coverage? What percentage of samples passed sequencing coverage but failed
# due to CNV calling?

# B) Does "sample_type" relate to failing sequencing coverage QC? Does "sample_type"
# relate to passing coverage but failing CNV calling QC?

# C) Which in-process QC metrics are indicative of failing sequencing due to low
# coverage? Which metrics are indicative of passing coverage but failing CNV calling?
# Report your findings graphically with a figure legend.

# D) Have the in-process QC metrics been stable over time (note: batches are processed
# in numerical order)? Report your findings graphically with a figure legend.

## Part 2
# A naive CNV calling algorithm relies on unbiased sequencing to identify deletions and
# duplications from sequence coverage alone. A common bias in sequencing workflows is
# related to the GC content of the targeted regions, such that targeted regions at the
# extremities are over- or under-represented. To reduce turn-around-time and cost,
# samples that will ultimately be deemed unreliable for CNV calling should be identified
# prior to the sequencing step.

# Concisely describe a high-throughput protocol for measuring GC-content bias in samples
# and how the data will be used to flag "bad" samples. Please include controls as
# appropriate.
