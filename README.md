Counsyl
========
This repository includes the raw data provided from Counsyl, and the code
I submitted during the interview process of applying for a bioinformatics job
at that company. Provided the correct prerequisite python packages, the code
will analyze the raw data and generate a few simple plots using ggplot2. 

Prerequisite python packages
 1. Rpy2 with ggplot2 installed as part of the R installation
 2. Pandas for dataframes

Installation
------------

``` python
python bin/code_example.py
```
